# Security Policy

## Look, It's a One-Man Show

VRS/A is a project built and maintained by one person. There are no official "versions" in the traditional sense. The only version that's supported is whatever is currently live.

| Version           | Supported? |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| The one on main   | ✅         |
| Anything else     | ❌         |

If you're running an old, local copy and something breaks, you're on your own. Pull the latest and try again.

## Found a Security Hole?

First off, nice job. Second, please tell me about it responsibly so I can fix it before it becomes a real problem.

**How to Report a Vulnerability (The Right Way):**

1.  **DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.** Let's not broadcast the problem to the world, okay?
2.  Email me directly at **vrsa.app@mailfence.com**.
3.  Use a clear subject line like "**VRS/A Security Vulnerability**" so it doesn't get lost in my inbox.
4.  In the email, tell me what you found. The more detail, the better. Steps to reproduce it are golden.

**What Happens Next:**

I'm just one guy, so I don't have a 24/7 security team. But I do take this stuff seriously.

* I'll try to get back to you within a couple of days to let you know I've seen it.
* I'll investigate and let you know if I can confirm the issue.
* I'll patch it as quickly as my caffeine-fueled coding sessions allow.
* I'll happily give you credit for the find once it's fixed (unless you want to be a silent hero).

Thanks for helping keep this thing from turning into a dumpster fire.
